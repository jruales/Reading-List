# React JS Resources

## React
* [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) by Facebook
  * Explains the process of turning a UI mockup into React code. Breaking up the UI into components, keeping state in a common parent component and passing it as props, passing down callback functions to enable inverse data flow.
* [Simple React Patterns (Dealing With Side-Effects In React)](https://getpocket.com/a/read/1931425942) by Lucas Reis (Zocdoc)
* [Learn React](https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm) by Kirupa Chinnathambi (Microsoft)
  * Good resource to get learn React when you don't know anything about it and need an initial push. Page-turner, kind of conversational, which makes it easy to go through it quickly, kind of like a friend explaining React to you. A lot of this content is also available in the book _Learning React_

## Redux
* [You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367) by Dan Abramov (co-author of Redux)
  * One of the co-authors of Redux explains that Redux imposes some strict requirements (1. Describe application state as plain objects and arrays. 2. Describe changes in the system as plain objects. 3. Describe the logic for handling changes as pure functions.) and introduces a lot of boilerplate code, which might not make sense in all situations.
  * The article includes a list of reasons why one might _actually_ want to use Redux, with each reason linking to a tutorial or other web resource
  * The author suggests having a good reason to use Redux, rather than just jumping on the bandwagon to use it straight away. He suggests making sure to get something good in return for the tradeoff that Redux imposes.
